This code is for the calculaiton of view factors and shading factors on a photovoltaic green roof as described and used in the published paper: [to be published]
Version 1 (_v1):
- Capability: calculation of view and shading factors for a green roof (rectangle) with 2 PV modules at any location given.
- Limitations: This version does not take into account the possibility of overlapping of the PV modules and the correction of view factors at overlapping (will be addressed at further version)
